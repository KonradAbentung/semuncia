# ideas
Having made a different money management program previously, I already have some
expectations as to what this software should do, and in which form it should
exist.

## platform
I want this software to be cross-platform with a html/css/javascript
webinterface ported to different platforms, such as Windows (Electron) and
Android (Cordova)

## features
This list of features is neither binding, nor finished. Finished items will be
~~crossed off~~.
* Ability to add transactions
* Ability to choose a category
* Autocomplete for transactions
* A graph showing different statistics over time
